## Overall goals that your plan should aim for

* Be able to chew through all the common toy problem topics (about a dozen topics, depending on how you count -- see the [Preparator directory structure](https://github.com/hackreactor/2016-02-preparator3000/tree/master/problems) for a starting point).
* Be able to answer a few types of knowledge questions — FE frameworks, JS idiosyncracies like hoisting, and system design, mostly.
* Be able to build small, useful working programs (like games, clocks, stoplights, etc) from scratch, on the fly.
* Be able to convincingly answer questions about your meatiest project on github.

## Time allocation

Your plan should describe your daily time allocation.

On average, you should aim to spend ~1/2 the day on sending out applications and doing live interviews, and ~1/2 the day on tech prep. 

If you have some different ratio than this, please call it out and the reason(s) why.

## Discrete outcomes

Your plan should describe your discrete daily outcomes.

* 5-7 apps out per day.
* Concrete progress on your written prep plan, expressed in terms of toy problems solved, wiki topics read and written, mock interviews done, and interview videos sent out for review. 

If you aren't aiming for 5-7 apps per day, please call that out and explain the reason(s) why.

## Topics you'll cover

Your plan should provide a list of topics you aim to cover, in order.

You shouldn't be doing graph problems before string problems, for example.

Beware of getting sucked into more-esoteric topics that don't come up often. Tries and self-balancing trees and red-black trees and suffix trees and Dijkstra’s algorithm and A* and whatnot, that’s amazing to learn but you don’t want to study all those only to get tripped up on some basic variations of linked list problems.

There's simply too much to study to cover it all. Be really tactical about what you invest time in.

## Depth of coverage

Your plan should indicate what does "good enough" mean? Is it the same investment for every topic?

## Formats

Your plan should describe how you'll get sufficient practice within these common formats:

* http://collabedit.com/
* https://coderpad.io/
* https://jsfiddle.net/ (for 'use {FE framework} to make {some small UI like a working clock}' problems)
* your own IDE (sublime text or vim or whatever)
* whiteboarding (you can mimic this reasonably on paper)

## Side projects

Please don't plan on doing any side projects... it's not that helpful for interviewing purposes. Great for later, of course, but get those offers first.  When you crush the interview by nailing problems live, the other side is highly motivated to open up their wallets. Project work is interesting but doesn't generally have that same effect!
