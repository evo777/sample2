A proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. The proxy is the man in the middle who knows the identity of the client and handles responses from the server on behalf of the client.

# What Proxies can Do
* Obscure client IP
* Block malicious traffic (partly)
* Block requests from client
* Log requests from client
* Improve performance through caching. Multiple clients can access cached resources on the proxy
* Access Cross Domain resources on behalf of client 
* Translate websites for clients
