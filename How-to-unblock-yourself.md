You never spend more than a brief time in "completely stuck" mode without trying something useful.

Build a problem-solving toolbox by trying one or more of these things when you get stuck:

* re-examining choice of data structure
* checking assumptions about problem statement
* walking thru the code ("being the interpreter")
* tweaking the tests or examining test output
* asking a specific clarifying question about requirements or constraints
* muse about possible alternative design or implementation options
