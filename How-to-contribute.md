## Writing style

Let's stick with a bullet-point oriented style.  Why? To keep the writing:

* concise
* easily editable
* easily rearrangeable
* relatively consistent in style and tone between entries

## Example entry

See the [cookies entry](What is a cookie?) for a canonical example of the bullet-point oriented style.
