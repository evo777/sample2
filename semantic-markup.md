# Semantic markup

The paradigm that our XML/HTML markup should refer to the content of the page and not the styling (see: separation of concerns). 

HTML5 made a big push for semantic markup and introduced a huge array of new semantic tags that make it easier to see at a glance the different roles of content on a page. This combats "div-itis", which is the old status quo that the vast majority of content is cordoned off into un-semantic \<div\> tags for styling purposes.

For a full list of new tags in HTML5, refer [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp). Generally we want to avoid using \<div\> now, if a semantic alternative exists. Use \<div\> if the only relationship between the grouped content is a stylistic grouping.
