#Objects

##What is it?
JavaScript contains two types of data: primitives (number, string, boolean, etc.) and objects/reference types (objects, functions, arrays). In other words, anything that is not a primitive type is an object.

In JavaScript, objects are aggregations of properties. This is in contrast to primitives, which do not have properties.

All objects eventually delegate to the Object prototype. However, arrays and functions have their own prototypes that "mask" the object prototype.
