How to succeed:

At Uber, we believe in collaboration and sharing ideas. Most importantly,
you'll need more information from the interviewer to analyze & answer the
question to its full extent.
* Its OK to question your interviewer.
* When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as
you see it.
* If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.
* If you need to assume something - verbally check its a correct
assumption!
* Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
* Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be
as interested in your process of thought as your solution.
Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're
doing.
* Finally, listen - don't miss a hint if your interviewer is trying to
assist you!

Interviewers will be looking at the approach to questions as much as the
answer:
* Does the candidate listen carefully and comprehend the question?
* Are the correct questions asked before proceeding? (important!)
* Is brute force used to solve a problem? (not good!)
* Are things assumed without first checking? (not good!)
* Are hints heard and heeded?
* Is the candidate slow to comprehend / solve problems? (not good!)
* Does the candidate enjoy finding multiple solutions before choosing the
best one?
* Are new ideas and methods of tackling a problem sought?
* Is the candidate inventive and flexible in their solutions and open to
new ideas?
* Can questioning move up to more complex problem solving?

Sample Topics:

Coding
Sample topics: construct / traverse data structures, implement system
routines, distill large data sets to single values, transform one data set
to another.

Algorithm Design / Analysis
Sample topics: big-O analysis, sorting and hashing, handling obscenely
large amounts of data. Also see topics listed under 'Coding'.

System Design
Sample topics: features sets, interfaces, class hierarchies, designing a
system under certain constraints, simplicity and robustness, tradeoffs.

Open-Ended Discussion
Sample topics: biggest challenges faced, best/worst designs seen,
performance analysis and optimization, testing, ideas for improving
existing products.

ALWAYS test your code.
