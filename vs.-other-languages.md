Here's how you might describe JavaScript relative to other programming languages:

* Intended for client, server, web. Other programming languages might focus exclusively on system level applications
* Scripting language [Lua, Perl] [non-scripting languages like C, C++, Java require explicit compilation step]
* Single-threaded [some languages like ruby support multithreading]
* Functions are first class citizens [Haskell] [Second class functions -> C] 
* Functional Scoping (& block scoping in ES6)
* Standardized language [ECMA] [Esoteric lanaguages like Arnold C are not standardized].
* No explicit typing, loosely typed [Perl] [a strongly-type language - C, Java]
* Supports both object-oriented and functional paradigms
* Higher level language [similar to Python] [lower level -- C, Assembly]
* No concept of mutability (w/o libraries) [Python has sense of mutability]
* Type coercion is opt-out by default
* Employs hoisting
