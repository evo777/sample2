**Hacktivator** is a step-by-step program for rounding out your technical preparation for your interviews.

# Phases

The steps are broken out into the following major phases. The phases are to be done in order, but the steps within them can be mixed-and-matched.

Refer to the [calendar breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Da9u7yoGlN4HvlWoa9Z2Qz_snq4LK9pr8MINQx_h1AY/edit#gid=83650198) to guide your progress through the phases.

## Phase 0: Make your plan!
* [[How to make a tech prep plan]]
* Share your plan with Tim.

## Phase 1: Review the building blocks
* Review our mental models regarding **interviewing**
* Review **key technical concepts**
* Meanwhile in parallel begin the job hunt -- start sending out resumes.

## Phase 2: Video-based mock interviews
* Conduct, record, and assess mock interviews on your own / with peers
* Receive go-ahead based on staff review of your mock interview video(s)

## Phase 3: Live Interviews
* Record and assess live phone screens
* Report difficulties to staff on the `#hacktivator` channel in your cohort's Slack team, or email tim.mansfield@hackreactor.com
* Report interview prompts to tim.mansfield@hackreactor.com

If you have questions about any of these steps, please post them via the same channels above.

# A closer look at each step

## Phase 1

### Review our mental models regarding interviewing

Let's make sure we have solid mental models about tech interviews and what's happening on the other side of the table.

* [[The Interviewer's Perspective]]
* [[Interview Strategy]]
* [[Interview Evaluation Checklist]]
* [[Iterative Interview Improvement]]
* [[Learnings from Interview Day]]

### Review key technical concepts

## Phase 2

### Mock interviews on your own / with peers

Radiating competency during the interview is mostly a matter of rehearsal. You can get a lot of mileage out of simply planning and practicing an organized approach to performing (see [[Interview Strategy]]).

A very effective technique for practice is to record a video of yourself performing. You then watch and assess the video as though you were the interviewer.

Of course, you also should have someone else evaluate it, as you can. However that’s a pretty limited resource, and should be used primarily to help you get better at self-evaluating. It’s a bit like practicing for a music recital or a golf tournament -- you have to put in a lot of individual practice time. There’s some coaching, but the coach isn’t there 24/7. The coach helps you understand what to work on, what good performance looks like, but it’s up to you to internalize and activate that knowledge. Recording and watching your own videos is the tech-interview equivalent of that.

##### Video Submission Process for Peer Review:

* Upload an unlisted YouTube video by changing your [privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en)
* Submit your video using this form: [Video Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/hackreactor.com/forms/d/1n7iReJ9d4Ijwnknt_kAIN43G5TlYFKj8ucqvENOu5ZY/viewform)
* Choose a peer to have him/her provide feedback on your video. They should submit their feedback via this form: [Peer Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/a/hackreactor.com/forms/d/1lFanmGg0D5AYvVcs0omm1oXpsq4KPoseTjaECKPsz5w/viewform)
	
**NOTE:** You are responsible for choosing your peer and sending your video for his/her review.  It is up to you to ensure that your peer submits the feedback form.
* Your feedback from your peer will be e-mailed to you
* Your peer will evaluate with feedback whether he/she believes you will pass a real life interview.  Once you receive an e-mail with a "Yes" status from your peer, and you strongly believe it is good enough for a staff review, submit your video for staff review using this form: [Video Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/hackreactor.com/forms/d/1n7iReJ9d4Ijwnknt_kAIN43G5TlYFKj8ucqvENOu5ZY/viewform) 
 
##### Important Dates to Remember for Students:

* May 30 (Monday): Submit first video for peer review - OK to have previous multiple submissions
* June 3 (Friday): Submit first video for staff review - OK to have previous multiple submissions 
* June 7 (Tuesday): Last chance to submit a video for staff review 

Also reference the [calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Da9u7yoGlN4HvlWoa9Z2Qz_snq4LK9pr8MINQx_h1AY/edit#gid=83650198) for details.

You have **2 weeks to submit up to 3 times** for staff review. At minimum, you must submit to receive at least 1 staff review. 

Your video will be reviewed by the staff within 3 days.


### Mock interview videos, staff-reviewed

When you have practiced on your own enough that you and a peer agree that you are mostly passing the assessment checklist, you submit a video to the staff.

##### Video Submission Process for Staff Review:

* Submit your video using this form: [Video Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/hackreactor.com/forms/d/1n7iReJ9d4Ijwnknt_kAIN43G5TlYFKj8ucqvENOu5ZY/viewform)
* The staff will receive an e-mail to review your video.  The e-mail will include the feedback you received from your peer.   
* The staff will provide feedback using this form: [Staff Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/a/hackreactor.com/forms/d/1qdhcPiB0190Ruiz_knsTEETjdt64yb9L1Fl9_NLwOcQ/viewform) 
* Your feedback from the staff will be e-mailed to you

## Phase 3

### Record phone screens

As you go through the real-world interview process, there's no reason not to keep improving!

Recording your phone screens and applying the same assessment criteria is a great way to do that.

If you find you are having difficulties passing phone screens, then these recordings and the assessments will help us pinpoint areas to practice before your next go.

## Help collect real-world feedback

As you encounter interview problems and interview questions, you can send them in to the Outcomes team to incorporate into the prep material. It is not ethical to maintain a database of raw questions as-is, but we can use that data, suitably anonymized and generalized, to enhance the prep phase.

In general if you have ideas for improving the prep material, of course, let's hear them. We don't want to distract you from your primary job search activities, but to the extent that you have time and energy, let's work together to improve things.
