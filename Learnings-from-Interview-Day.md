###### *[[Hacktivator]] > [Phase 1](https://github.com/hackreactor/peripheral-brain/wiki/Hacktivator#phase-1-review-the-building-blocks) > Review our mental models regarding interviewing*

This is an aggregate of feedback given by interviewers and observers during Interview Day (May 2016).

## Demeanor, rapport, framing, passion

* Stop saying sorry.
* Don't tell them you "suck" at something! 
* Don't talk about what you HAVEN'T done but rather talk about what you ARE familiar with.
* Don't be so self-deprecating.
* Don't highlight your inexperience. Honesty is good but don't undersell yourself.
* Decrease the amount of 'uhhh's you say. 
* Don't "mmm" or "hmm" or "er".
* during the Q&A part it felt like you weren't holding a dialogue, you were seeking validation. Seemed unsure of yourself and looking for confirmation rather than speaking with confidence.
* Slow down and breathe deep. 
* slow your pace and you'll sound less anxious
* Speak a little more slowly
* Some gestures made you come across as a little shy, e.g. covering your face with your hand,  resting your face in your left hand, lowered eyes instead of more confident eye contact.
* definitely work on being more confident and enthusiastic 
* Improve on projecting your voice and improving your confidence. 
* Don't second guess yourself, be more confident.
* Don't lead by saying "my major was in (non-technical field), and I've never been a technology-type person"
* Talk a bit louder and more clearly when thinking out loud. 
* Try to avoid long silences.
* Be more positive. You showed lack of interest toward the end of the interview.
* work on projecting your voice more
* Be more confident in the interview. Some people might interpret the lack of confidence as a lack of technical knowledge.
* Have more enthusiasm. I wasn't excited throughout the interview because you didn't seem excited.
* The "tell me about yourself" was a little rehearsed as it didn't seem like the natural response
* Speak more clearly and loudly. I had a hard time hearing what you were saying 90% of the time.
* work on making more eye contact and sounding more confident
* Try to come across less nervous.
* Relax.
* Work on being a little more easy going and confident
* Bring the energy level up.
* Speak a little more loudly, and project a little more confidence.
* Project your voice confidently.
* You didn't sound super confident as to what that line(s) should be returning.
* Body language could be more confident.
* Needs to work on confidence.
* During white boarding, you don't need to ask permission to do something.
* Have more genuine enthusiasm for technology and software engineering and being a hard worker and ambitious, not as much focus on chilling.
* Proceed more crisply and actively; offer answers and identify assumptions as opposed to asking questions in a way that makes you sound unsure of your own abilities.
* You came across as somewhat rigid. You spoke rapidly and in a way that didn't seem to invite questions.
* Most of your answers were good content-wise, but they came across a bit stilted.
* Was unclear if you moved to San Francisco to enjoy the city or become a software engineer. Your passion should shine.
* You were too nervous to answer most questions properly. In the technical problem, it took you about 30 minutes to understand what the question was asking. To address this: 
  * practice talking to people confidently. 
  * Try to build rapport first. 
  * Study coding problems like crazy to be able to grasp what they are asking/generally looking for in different types of problems.
* Some of the time the interviewer could not even see what you were writing down because your body was blocking it. Remember, a lot of the interview process is about connecting with the interviewer and having them feel they’d like to work with you 8 hours a day. 
* Work on enthusiasm and confidence when talking about what excites you and what you worked on. 
* Work on being a little more easy going and confident
* Don't give up! You're going to get hard questions, embrace it and push through.


## Clear and concise communicator

* A lot of your answers were very long and unfocused.
* Concentrate on practicing giving more concise answers.
* Keep your narrative shorter.
* Make sure to answer the question asked.
* Draw more diagrams.
* Be more structured in your thought process. At times, you were very "in the weeds" of the problem and it was hard to follow.
* Some of your answers ran long, which risked the interviewer getting lost in the answers. I would suggest keeping responses to questions to under a minute.
* don't ramble, be clear and concise, be comfortable with silence while you figure out how to frame your approach in a logical way.
* be up-front with what you don't know and then demonstrate your reasoning ability by offering your best guess as to what is going on. 
* verbalize problems instead of thinking inside your head
* Your intro was just very long and unguided. Make answers more brief and allow time for guided follow-ups instead.
* You went WAY too deep into a pretty basic thing, so the fact that you discussed it for so long made me less confident in your abilities and also made me lose interest.

## Think ahead -- make & communicate a plan

* diagram/think about the problem a little bit more before jumping into code
* Take one minute to think about the high level goals of a problem before diving into coding. It will most likely save you time overall.
* Lay out your approach before you start writing it (aka pseudo code whole problem). Convince the interviewer of your plan.
* Understand more the problem before to jumping in
* Had to assign variables at the end when it should have been done from the start. It's more important to have easy-to-understand code than to have brief code.
* Avoid jumping straight into code for a white board problem. Do pseudo coding first.
* You want to be so sure of your algorithm (plan, approach) before you start coding that the actual coding of it seems like a chore. Explore all sides of the problem beforehand, then convince your interviewer of your plan. 
* Ask clarifying questions earlier on to avoid talking yourself into a corner. 
* Clarify and communicate your approach upfront, before diving into code.
* Whiteboard more before tackling the problem.
* Explore more datasets of the problem before developing a ruleset.
* Always start solving problems in "logic mode" and only move to code-specific stuff after you have a clear plan of attack.
* Step back from the problem and develop a larger dataset before tackling the problem programmatically.
* Diagram before pseudo-coding.
* You jumped right into coding. Should have done pseudo-code first.
* Ask more questions before you write code. Writing code is expensive and finding out you have misconceptions after there is code on the board is a bad idea.
* You should have done more clarification at the beginning to make sure you're understanding the problem correctly.
* Give more of the overall picture of your plan before diving into code.
* Think about the general strategy before starting actual coding.
* Pseudocode first to clearly communicate your general strategy and then start coding.
* Try to solve problems more iteratively. Pause, test ideas, and ask questions/explain thought process as you encounter difficulties.
* Work on isolating your problems. Don't try to solve everything at once.
* Make sure you have a really strong sense of the algorithm you want to implement before you jump into code. Even if the problem asks for code, it may help to write some sort of pseudocode.
* Consider thinking through different ways of approaching the problem before attempting a solution.
* Don't be afraid to think through the problem more on the whiteboard before tackling the implementation on the computer.
* You would benefit from clearly identifying the requirements of every problem, big or small, before trying to solve it.
* Pseudocode or write out the approach before writing the code.
* Break bigger problems into smaller problems. 
* You jumped straight into coding too fast. Make sure to take the time to fully understand the problem.
* Start with coding little bits of the problem and testing them.
* You could have benefited from structuring your approach at the start of the coding challenge, would have saved time during the coding.

## Be pair-worthy / unblock yourself

* Explicitly CHECK IN with your interviewer to make sure they are following your thought process: ask them if what you said makes sense to them, or if they’d like you to clarify anything, and do this regularly as you whiteboard.
* Try pseudo coding before diving into code.
* Clarify your overall approach more, both for yourself and the interviewer. Sometimes your interviewer seemed lost on your larger direction and had to jump in and ask for clarification.
* You could have checked in with the interviewer a lot more. They will often give hints if you ask if you're on the right track or if they think something you're trying is a good idea.
* You got stuck at the whiteboard and should have verbalized where you were stuck instead of trying to muscle through the problem.
* Don't rush speech, communicate thought process even if you're stumbling on a problem it's better to keep talking than to stop.
* Rushed very fast through basic things making silly mistakes.
* Write more tests as you go.
* Slow down, take the time to clearly lay out your plan. Try hard to get that game plan clearly into the interviewer's mind.
* Be comfortable with no typing. Let yourself think.
* Don't be afraid to not know the answer. Ask for clarification.
* You were a little bit slow on actively incorporating my hints to improve your solution. When the interviewer tries to help you, drop all your thinking and definitely think about best incorporating the feedback to improve your approach.
* I think it took a while for you to take some of my cues in answering the question, since you were stuck on one approach a little too long.
* I'm not sure you were following with the problem 100% and confused yourself with inconsistencies. 
* Watch out for over-optimizing as you code. If you get stuck, go back to the big picture
* work on making sure interviewer is following along while whiteboarding
* Silence is your enemy! Talk through your approach.
* ask more clarifying questions.
* Check for edge cases, check for understanding.
* When whiteboarding, draw more!
* Make sure to do the specific thing that was asked. E.g., draw out the *architecture* rather than the *state* of the application.
* It's ok to move on if you can't remember something. Need to verbalize thought process even if you dont know next steps.
* Instead of talking non-stop and second-guessing yourself, try to engage the interviewer with questions. 
* You were confusing yourself a bit trying to do something the interviewer didn't even want.


## Technical stuff

* Since you listed "React" as "strong" I would be prepared to answer a lot of questions about that.
* You need to flesh out the skills you're presenting as your main strengths. For example, you have to able to talk in detail about React-Redux if say you're good at React.
* You need a lot more practice with algorithms.
* Drill algorithms live (as in talking out loud to mimic interview situations).
* Seemed to blank a bit at the whiteboarding section in reasoning about time complexity
* Learn data structures you can apply to path problems. 
* review data structures and be more prepared to discuss their pros and cons
* Needs more practice on data structures
* Look up dynamic programming--best approach for this type of problem.
* Do more DP problems.
* Practice toy problems more
* Learn how to implement depth-first search and breadth-first search
* review how to implement DFS and BFS.
* Review depth vs breadth search
* Be stronger in tree traversal
* study up on the standard answer for BFS with a queue
* focus more on data structures
* Try to improve answers about your technology choices.
* Review SQL.
* Review call stacks.
* Learn more about databases.
* Learn more about security.
* Study up on how browser's work, the DOM, html, etc.
* Know React and Redux.
* practice toy problems more. 
* Study front-end framework technologies and their benefits.
* Prepare to explain how you might scale your project.
* Work on toy problems involving data structures.
* Practice more toy problems and try to do them faster. 
* Practice more toy problems to get a better sense of the types of problems that can be asked.
* Drill time complexity analysis, and crack down on toy problems
* needs more practice with algorithms. 
* review the basic concepts about restful apis.
* study more about restful apis
* Naming of variables, clarity of psuedo code. 
* needs more practice with fundamental concepts like closures
* Make sure practice a lot of toy problems
* Practice toy problems
* practice fundamental concepts like callbacks/promises/asynchronicity
* Work on some general computing concepts (e.g. caching)
* practice recursion
* know async functions
* need more practice iwth ES6 concepts, dig deeper into subject matter. For example: when/how arrow functions are different than regular 'function' functions
* study more about databases and schemas
* brush up on the fundamentals of HTML / CSS & how browsers work
* try not to frame everything in terms of React - it should be a tool that you use, not your only way to interact with the browser
* Drill time complexity and "difficult" algorithm concepts (graph traversal/decision trees are common) and get used to recognizing the larger patterns of these problems.
* Practice data structures and get familiar with trees!
* Seemed to me like you didn't understand the difference between `let` and  `const` well enough.
