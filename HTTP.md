# HTTP

## What is it?
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
- Designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.
- Follows the client-server model:
  - Client opens a connection
  - Client makes a request
  - Client waits for response from server
- HTTP is stateless. Each requests is treated independently and the server does not save any state between requests.
- Generally, HTTP requests occur over the TCP/IP layer (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). However, they can also occur over any other connection-oriented transport layer.
