# HTTP Headers

## What are they?
- Headers are included with every HTTP message sent over the network.
- They describe the resource being fetched or the behavior of the server/client

## Example headers
- Accept: lists the MIME types accepted by the agent (e.g., the server)
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Indicates the methods allowed when accessing the resources (e.g., GET, POST, etc.)
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Indicates the URI that is allowed to access the resources. The '*' wildcard can be used to allow any URI
