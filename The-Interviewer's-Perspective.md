## Key takeaways

As a job-seeker, you need to understand what interviewers (or hiring managers) want.

1. Focus on them, not yourself.
2. Remember that they want you to succeed.
3. Show them that you will be able to solve problems at their company.

The rest of this page will delve deeper into these three items.

### 1. Focus on them, not you.
When you're looking for a job, it's natural to focus on yourself. Your own hopes and worries are at the forefront of your mind.

However, you'll be more likely to succeed if you make an effort to understand the people on the other side of the table.

### 2. They want you to succeed.

The key thing to remember about the job search process: Hiring managers are eager to hire you.

They don't really like having to recruit. It's a necessary set of chores, but in itself it's not adding customer-facing value or directly solving any problems. They'd love to be able to get it over with, and just hire you.

In that sense, they're actually on your side. They want you to succeed in this process. It doesn't give them any pleasure to have to turn you down, at any stage.

When they can visualize you solving the kind of problems they have at their company, they will be eager to hire you. Therefore...

### 3. Show them you can solve problems.

Here are some things that go through their minds as they do that visualization process.

#### Hard stuff

* Is this person a real engineer? Not just copy-paste-tweak / stitching things together from Stack Overflow entries. 
* Can this person really build things from scratch, or do they need to be hand-held a lot? Are they completely dependent on other people's code or setup to do all the hard work? 
* Are they fluent in their chosen programming language, frameworks, tools?
* Do they have solid technical design instincts?
* Do they have real CS knowledge?
* Does this person have solid mental models? Do they know how things really work under the hood? 
* Are they great at problem decomposition?
* Can they effectively manage complexity? 
* Do they have a clear, logical problem-solving approach? Careful? Organized? 
* Are they solid on testing? -- both philosophically and practically?

#### Soft stuff

* Do they “get it”? Do they pattern-match as an engineer? Can I see them solving a lot more problems than they create for me?
* Can they translate seamlessly between levels of abstraction -- from plain-English problem statements/instructions to “computerese” (programming abstractions) to actual working code?
* Can they stay on track? Can they rapidly and repeatedly get themselves unstuck?
* Can they learn and adapt quickly enough to provide lots of value in the expected, probably-short ramp-up timeframe?
* Can they communicate clearly? Spoken? Written? 
* There’s always politics and personalities involved in doing work together. Is this person at least minimally savvy and personable and professional enough to operate in any team? How about in the specific team(s) that s/he is being considered for?
* Are they achievers? Do they have a track record that looks like they get shit done and drive results, over and over? 
* Do they really want to be here, at this company, or is this a “spray and pray” candidate?

#### Bullshit detection

* All resumes are inflated to some degree. How inflated is this person's resume?
* How much of what they claim to have done, was primarily done by other members of their team?
* Even if I am able to look at a git log, because of pairing I still don't necessarily know who did the work.
* What's actually behind each of the technology/tool keywords they list? Often people have only a passing familiarity, not real competency.
