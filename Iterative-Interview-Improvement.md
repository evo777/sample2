The key to getting better a tech interviews is to treat each one as an experiment, and learn from it.

You go into the interview with a hypothesis that you have [adequately prepared](What to do to prepare). Behind this is a set of hypotheses about [[what constitutes adequate preparation for a specific interview]].

As the interview unfolds, you have the opportunity to gather data about your performance, and more broadly about the nature of technical interviewing.

After the interview, you have an opportunity to analyze that data. On that basis you can adjust your hypotheses and adjust your training plan to match your updated understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.

If you do the above steps repeatedly and in good faith, with regular additional feedback from Hack Reactor staff, you will succeed.
