# Transpiling

## What is it?
- Transpiling is the process of taking source code written in one language and converting it to another language with a similar level of abstraction. In the context of JavaScript, this generally means taking code in the most recent version of the language (e.g., ES6/7) and converting it to a version that is supported by most browsers.
- Babel is a popular transpiler for JavaScript
