[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [ResetCSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) seek to mitigate the small inconstancies between the default css of all bowsers.  There are a few differences.

* ResetCSS blows away everything; all margins, padding, borders, fonts, aligning, display settings (block, float, etc) are set to nothing.
* Normalize.css tries to do things with a bit more finesse, and keeps many things the way you might expect, such as H1 tags being bigger than h2 tags.
