MySQL is the most popular one of all the large-scale database servers - pretty much an industry standard.

Advantages:

* Easy to install, many 3rd-party tools are available

* Feature-rich

* Has advanced security features

* Fast (because MySQL does not follow all the ANSI standards)

Disadvantages:

* Does not implement the full SQL standard

* Some functionalities are less reliable than other RDBMS, e.g. references, transactions, auditing

* Development has stagnated since MySQL was acquired (by Sun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle)

MySQL is a flexible tool that is good for web apps and custom solutions, but it is lacking in SQL compliance and many of its functionalities are dependent on add-ons.
