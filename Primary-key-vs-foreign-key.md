# Primary Key
A primary key uniquely identifies a record in a database table. A primary key cannot accept null values. By default, database records are ordered by the primary key value. Only one primary key field can exist in a table.

# Foreign Key
A foreign key is a field in a table that is a primary key in another table, allowing the table with the foreign key to reference the table that the primary key originated from. You can have more than one foreign key in a table.
